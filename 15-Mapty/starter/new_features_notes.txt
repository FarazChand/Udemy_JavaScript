Common problems:
LIVE SERVER NOT RELOADING
- had to restart computer, delete dist and .parcel-cache directories, started working after that

Edit a workout:

Remove a workout:

*Adding a 'select' box to list items:
- on all workouts, there will be a box that the user can click to select a workout
- when selected, these boxes will have a different appearence, might do this on hover as well
- a user will be able to select multiple workouts, and deselect workouts as they please
- going to experiment with making it have the same color as its type value (left border, marker)


+HTML:
-> note that I am attempting to leave room for an edit button in the future
-> I will probably put the edit button and this select button in the same div, then put that div beside the title element of the list item
-> I want the check to be to either the left or right of the title, need to experiment, but definetly on the same horizontal axis
-> Because the original html for the list used grid, it will be innefficient to change all the code to include the box in the grid
-> Instead, I will absolutely position the box in the top right corner
-> Edit: I think we'll be replacing the title element with a div that contains the title AND this new element that contains our buttons
-> we'll then make this div span accross the whole row of the grid, and use flex box to space it out the way we want to



+Functionality:
-> I need to add a property to all list items that keeps track of whether an item has been selected or not
-> the default value will be set to not selected (false)
-> since I want this to be added to all list items, aka all workouts, I need to add the property to the parent Workout class
-> when the relevent element is clicked, this value will change to true (selcted)


*Delete Button:
- there will be a red button at the top of the side bar, below the title but above the form
- when this button is pressed, all selected elements will be deleted, and the local data will be updated
- this button will appear after at least one list item has been added
