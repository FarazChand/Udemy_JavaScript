// https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/{name}

// Old-school: XML http request function:
// ======================================
// - use the new keyword followed by the function and store it in a variable
// - use the 'open' method and pass the type of request we want as the first arg, and the URL we want to request from as the second arg
// - on github's public API lists, you can see a list of API's available
// - they also specify if 'Auth' , HTTPS, and CORS are enabled?
// - it's really important for 'CORS' aka 'Cross Origin Resource Sharing' to be enabled, without it - we can't access a 3rd party API from our own code

// Sending request, fetches data in the background:
// - after we send our "GET" request, we now have to request a "SEND" so that we can receive the data - once finished, a load event is emitted
// - this process takes long and runs in the background, so we can't just store the result in a variable, because that line of code would execute before the request even finished - making the value stored undefined?

// Using an event listener to listen for the load event emitted by the Send request:
// - instead, we listen for the load event and run a callback function once it happens
// - we are sent back a JSON string which is saved into one of the request object's properties
// - we can look at the data by accessing the request objects '.responseText' property
// - what we get in return is a JSON formatted string containing the information we requested
// - we just have to turn this result into an object now

// Turning JSON into an OBJECT:
// - we do this by passing the JSON string into the 'JSON.parse' method
// - in this case, this returns an array of one index containing the new object
// - this is because of how the JSON was formatted, we can simply destructure this
// - by doing so, we will be dealing with a single obeject with all the data sent back from the request

*/
//////////////////////////////////////////////////

// Asynchronous JS:
// - its goal is to deal with long running tasks that basically run in the background
// - the most common use case of asynchronous JS is to fetch data from remote servers in so called 'AJAX' calls

// Asynchronous JS, AJAX and APIs
// - most frequent use of Asynchronous JS is to make AJAX calls to APIs

// Synchronous:
// - most code is synchronous
// - means that it is executed line by line
// - each line of code waits for previous line to finish
// - can create problems if some code takes longer to execute
// - long operations BLOCK code execution, e.g. an alert window

// Asynchronous:
// - Asynchronous code is executed after a task that runs in the 'background' finishes, e.g. a timer with a callback
// - asynchronous code is non- blocking
// - Execution does not wait for an asynchronous task to finish its work, so the rest of the code can keep running normally
// - callback functions ALONE do not make code asynchronous, e.g. the .map method for arrays
// - event listeners ALONE do not make code asynchronous..
// - for example, an event listener listening for a click is not doing any work in the background, it's simply waiting for a click to happen

// Asynchronous JS is all about coordinating the behavior of a program over a period of time

// AJAX:
// - Asynchronous Java Script And Xml
// - allows us to communicate with remote web servers in an asynchronous way
// - with AJAX calls, we can request DATA from web servers dynamically, aka without loading the page
// - lets a client do an http request to a server for some data, the server will then send back a response containing the data requested.. happens asynchronously
// - when we ask a server to send us some data, this server usually has a web API that contains the data that we're asking for - making APIs important

// API:
// - Application Programming Interface
// - a piece of software that can be used by another piece of software, in order to allow applications to talk to each other and exchange information
// - not true just for programming in JS, but in programming in general
// - there may be many APIs in web development

// 'Online' API:
// - Application running on a server, that receives request for data, and send data back as response
// - in practice, these are just called APIs or web APIs..
// - note that the term web API is also used for other things
// - we can build our own web APIs, but that requires back-end development e.g. with node.js
// - we can also use 3rd party APIs

// XML:
// - a data format that used to be widely used to transmit data on the web
// - these days basically no API uses XML anymore
// - the term AJAX is a very popular term that got famous back in the day, and is still used today
// - the 'x' in AJAX stands for XML, even though no one really uses XML anymore
// - instead, most API's these days use the JSON format
// - JSON is the most popular object these days because it's basically just a JS object, but converted to a string
// - this makes it very easy to send across the web, and also to use in JS once it arrives

// Alternate URLS for this section:
// https://restcountries.com/v2/
// https://restcountries.com/v3.1/

//////////////////////////////////////////////////

// How the Web Works: Requests and Responses:
// - whenever we try to access a web server, the browser - which is the client, sends a request to the server
// - the server will then send  back a response
// - this response contains the data or the web page that we requested
// - this process works the exact same way, no matter if we are accessing an entire webpage, or just some data from a web API
// - this whole process is called the "Reequest-response model" or the "Client-server architecture"

// URLs:
// Example: https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${country}

// - Every URL gets an 'http' or an 'https', which is for the protocol that will be used on this connection
// then, we have the 'domain name', which is 'restcountries.com' in this case
// then also, after a backslash, we have the so called 'resource' that we want to access, which is '/v3.1/name/${country}' in this case

// - now, the shown domain name in the Example url is actually NOT real the address of the server
// - it's really just a nice name that is easy for us to memorize
// - what this means is that we a need a way of converting the domain name to the real address of the server
// - this happens through a so called 'DNS', which stands for 'Domain Name Server'
// - DNS are a special kind of server - they are basically like the phone books of the internet

// - The first step that happens when we access any web server:
// - the browser makes a request to a DNS
// - this special server will then simply match the web address of the url to the servers REAL IP address
// - this all happens through your internet service provider
// - after the IP address has been sent back to the browser, we can finally call it

// IP:
// Example: https://104.17.142.889.443
// - this is what the real address looks like
// - it still has the protocol in the beginning (http/https)
// - then comes the IP address
// - the last numbers are the port that we access on the server (443)

// - this port number is really just to identify a specific service that is running on a server
// - so you can think of it like a sub address
// - the default '443' for HTTPS, 80 for HTTP
// - the port number has nothing to do with the resource part of the URL that we want to access

// - one we have the real IP address, a TCP (TCP/IP ?) socket connection is established between the browser and the server - meaning they are now connected
// - this connection is typically kept alive for the entire time that it takes to transfer all files of the website or all data

// TCP: the transmission control protocol
// IP: the internet protocol
// - together, they are communication protocols that define exactly how data travels across the web
// - they are basically the internets fundamental control system
// - this is because they are the ones that set the rules on how data moves on the internet

// - now its time to finalLy make our request
// - the request we make is a http protocol
// - http stands for 'hyper text transfer protocol'
// - after tcp/ip, http is another communication protocol
// - a communication protocol is simply a system of rules that allows two or more parties to communicate
// - in the case of 'http', it's just a protocol that allows that allows clients and web servers to communicate
// - this works by sending request and response messages from clients to server an back

// LOOK AT VIDEO TO SEE EXAMPLE OF AN HTTP REQUEST
// - the beginning of an http request is called a 'start line', which contains the http method that is used in the request, then the request target, and also the http version
// - there are many http methods available - but the most important ones are GET, POST, PUT and PATCH
// - GET simply requests data
// - POST sends data
// - PUT and PATCH basically modifies data

// - the request target is where the server is told that we want to access the specified resource (from the URL)
// - if the target is empty, we would just be accessing the websites root

// - the next part of the request are the request headers (many different possibilities)
// - which is just some information that we send about the request itself
// - there are tons of standard different headers

// - in the case that we are sending data to a server, there will also be a request body
// - this body will contain the data that we are sending, for example, coming from an HTML form

// - Now of course, it's not us developer who manually write these http requests
// - it's still helpful and valuable to understand what an http request and also a response look like

// - the main difference between http, and https is that https is encrypted using TLS or SSL - which are yet some more protocols
// - besides that, the logic behind http requests and responses still apply to https

// - so once our request is formed, it then hits the server - which will then be working on it until it has our data or webpage ready to send back
// - once it's ready, it will send it back using an http response
// - the http response message actually looks quite similar to the request (video)
// - it also contains a startline, headers and a body
// - the startline of a response message has a version, a status code and a status message
// - these are used to let the client know whether the request has been successful or failed, e.g. 200 means OK... or 404 Page not found
// - the response headers are information about the response itself, many possiblities, in fact, we can actually make up our own
// - the last part of the response is again the body, which is present in most responses
// - this body usually contains the JSON data coming back from an API or the HTML of the webpage we requested.. or something similar

// - an API only requires one request, a website might require many
// - this is because for a website, the first request will return an HTML address, which contains the information on all the assets that it needs
// - these assets being: JavaScript files, CSS files, Images, and other assets
// - this information is scanned by the browser
// - for each different file, there will be a new http request made to the server
// - there can be multiple requests happening at the same time, but the amount is still limited - otherwise the connection would start to slow down
// - when all the files have finaly arrived, then the webpage can be rendered in the browser according to the HTML, CSS JavaScript Specifications that we already know

// TCP/IP:
// - the communtication protocols that define how data travels accross the web
// - the job of TCP is to break the requests and responses down into thousands of small chunks called 'packets' before they are sent
// - once these small packets arrive at their final destination, TCP will reassemble all the packets into the original request or response
// - this is necessary so that each packet can take a different route through the internet
// - this way, the message arrives at the destination as quick as possible, which would not be possible if we sent the entire data simply as a big chunk

// - the job of the IP protocol is to actually send and route these packets through the internet
// - it ensures that they arrive at the destination they should go by using IP addresses on each packet

// Promises and the Fetch API

// // Old-school: XML http request function:
// const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
// // Sending a GET request, seems like you have to set this up first
// request.open('GET', `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${country}`);
// // Sending request, fetches data in the background, emits a load event when finished:
// request.send();

// Modern AJAX calls:
// ==================

// Using the fetch function:
const request = fetch(`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${'canada'}`);
// Promise is returned from the fetch function:
console.log(request);

// Modern AJAX calls:
// ==================

// Using the fetch function:
// - there are actually more options that we can specify if we'd like
// - these are for more complex AJAX calls, which can take an object of options
// - for a simple GET request like this one, all we really need is to pass in the URL

// Promise is returned from the fetch function:
// - so we started the request, stored the result into a variable and logged that variable to the console
// - we immediately got the promise, which is store in the request variable

// What is a Promise?
// ==================
// - an object that is used as a placeholder for the future result of an asynchronous operation
// - its like a container for an asynchronously delivered value
// - less formal, a container for a future value, for example, a response coming from an AJAX call

// - when we start the AJAX call, there is no value yet, but we know there will be some value in the future
// - we can use a promise to handle this future value
// - the advantage of promises is that we no longer need to rely on events and callbacks passed into asynchronous functions to handle asynchronous results
// - we can also chain promises for a sequence of asynchronous operations
// - this means no more nesting callbacks.. no more callback hell!

// - since promises work with asynchronous operations, they are time sensitive.. they change over time
// - this means that promises can be in different states
// - this is what we call the lifecycle of a promise

// Pending:
// - at the start, we say that a promise is 'pending'
// - this is before any value resulting from the asynchronous task is available
// - during this time, the asynchronous task is still doing its work in the background

// Settled:
// - then, once the asynchronous task has finished, we say that the promise has 'settled'
// - there are two different types of settled promises: fulfilled promises and rejected promises
// - fulfilled: a promise that has successfully resulted in a value, as we expected
// - rejected: there has been an error during the asynchronous task

// - we are able to handle these different states in our code
// - we can use them to do something as a result of either a successful promise or a rejected one

// - another important thing about promises is that a promise is only settled once
// - from there, the state will remain unchanged forever
// - it's either fulfilled or rejected, but its impossible to change that state

// Consume:
// - these states are relevant and useful when we use a promise to get a result, which is called to consume a promise
// - we consume a promise when we already have a promise, e.g. a promise returned from a fetch function
// - in order for a promise to exist in the first place, it must first be built
// - in the case of the fetch API, it's the fetch function that builds the promise amd return it for us to consume
// - in this case we don't have to build the promise ourselves in order to consume it

// - most of the time we will actually just consume promises, which is also the easier and more useful part
// - but sometimes, we also have to build a promise, and not just consume it

*/
/////////////////////////////////////////

// const request = new XMLHttpRequest();

// request.send();

// Modern AJAX calls:
// ==================

// Using the fetch function:
const request = fetch(`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${'canada'}`);
// Promise is returned from the fetch function:
// console.log(request);

const getCountryData = function (country) {
  // Calling the fetch function, which immediately returns a promise:
  fetch(`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${country}`)
    .then(function (response) {
      // Looking at the response, which is what the promise passes once fulfilled:
      console.log(response);
      // Calling the json method on the response, creating a promise and returning it:
      return response.json();
    })
    // Calling .then on the newly returned promise from the json method:
    .then(function (data) {
      // Looking at the response object:
      console.log(data);
      // Passing the data to our function in order to render the card:
      renderCountry(data[0]);
    });
};

// Function without comments, console logs, and with arrow functions
const getCountryDataClean = function (country) {
  fetch(`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${country}`)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => renderCountry(data[0]));
};

// Uncomment to see results:
// getCountryData('portugal');
// getCountryDataClean('portugal');

// Calling the fetch function, which immediately returns a promise:
// - in the beginning, the promise is still pending
// - eventually, the promise will be settled in either a fulfilled or rejected state
// - for this example, we will assume that it is fulfilled

// Calling the then method:
// - on all promises, we can call the 'then' method
// - into the then method, we need to pass a callback function that we want to be executed as soon as the promise is fulfilled - as soon as the result is available
// - this callback function will actually receive one argument when it is called by JS
// - this argument is the resulting value of the fulfilled promise
// - we're calling it 'response' because it is the response of an AJAX call in this case
// - it is actually an object

// Looking at the response, which is what the promise passes once fulfilled:
// - notice that this response contains properties that look extremely similar to an http request... e.g. status code, headers
// - the body property is the property that contains the data we are after
// - also note that the 'body' property contains a value of 'Readable Stream' that we can't really look at or get any real information from

// Calling the json method on the response, creating a promise and returning it:
// - in order to read that data contained in the body,  we need to call the '.json' method on the response
// -'.json' is a method that is available on all response objects of the fetch function, aka all of the resolved values of the fetch function
// - the problem here is that this json method itself is actually also an asynchronous function
// - this means that it will also return a new promise
// - we don't know why it was implemented this way, this is just how it works
// - we want to continue to work with the value that this promise produces once fulfilled, so we return it

// Calling .then on the newly returned promise from the json method:
// - since we returned the promise from the json method, we can now call the .then method on it as well
// - once again, the .then method takes a call-back function which in this case receives the resolved value from the promise it is called on as an argument
// - we will be calling this argument 'data' in this example

// Looking at the resolved value:
// - if we log the resolved value to the console, we will see that we can now access the data we intended to
// - what is returned in this case is an array with one index containing an object that contains all the data we are looking for

// Passing the data to our function in order to render the card:
// - we can just pass the first index of data since it is an array with one index, we just need the info from the object, not the whole array that contains the object

//
//
// Overview:
// - we create a function that takes an argument which represents the name of the country we want to get data from
// - in the body of our function, the first thing we do is call the fetch function
// - we pass the function the url where we want to get data from, and replace the relevant field with our country argument - accessing the url where the data we want is located
// - this creates a promise, which starts as pending but ends up being fulfilled in this case
// - one fulfilled, we then call a method on this promise(kind of like stringing methods here)
// - the method we call is called the 'then' method, which all fulfilled promises have access to
// - this method receives an argument that represents the response object of the promise made by the fetch function
// - this allows us to work with this response object

// - however, we cannot access the data directly from this object, we have to call the .json method on it in order to access the data
// - the .json method is available on all the fulfilled promises - on their response objects
// - the problem with this method is that it is also an asynchronous function, so it also creates a promise
// - this means that we can call the .then method on it as well
// - we do this to continue working with the chain of events

//////////////////////////////////////////////

// Chaining Promises:
// - we actually already have a chain of promises because of the json function
// - the two 'then' methods called in sequence are already a small chain
// - we will now chain two sequential AJAX calls
// - we already have the data about the country, we now want to get the data about the neighbouring country
// - the second AJAX call depends on the first call, so they need to be done in sequence

const getCountryAndNeighbor = function (country) {
  // First AJAX call: Getting the data for the first country:
  fetch(`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${country}`)
    // Promise resolved, returned the response object - convert to usable data with '.json':
    .then(response => response.json())

// In the last lecture, Jonas actually over simplified how things really work
// - the 'then' method always returns a promise no matter if we actually return anything or not
// - but if we do return a value, then that value will become the 'fulfillment value' of the returned promise
// - all promises have a 'then' method which we can use to handle the promise once it has been fulfilled
// - so the data that we receive as an argument of our 'then' method will be the fulfillment value of the promise that we are handling aka the promise we called the method on
// - while using the 'then' method on a promise, if we return another promise - for example, we return another fetch function call, then the fulfilled value of the NEXT 'then' method will be the fulfilled value of the returned promise.
// - in other words, the returned promise will be fulfilled, and the fulfillment value that it produced will be used as the argument for the next 'this' method
// - promises really allow us to handle these complex asynchronous operations with as many steps as we want
// - promises still use callback, but we don't have to deal with callback hell, makes everything easy to understand and to read

// First AJAX call: Getting the data for the first country:
// - we use the URL that is specifically for country NAMES

// Second AJAX call: Getting data for the neighbour country:
// - we use the URL that is specifically for country CODES
// - we return the promise (result of the fetch function)
// - we do this so we can chain the 'this' method
// - similar steps as before

//

// Overview:
// - the fetch function creates a promise, this promise is returned
// - the 'then' method is called on this promise only AFTER it has been fulfilled, aka after the asynchronous function finishes execution and a value is returned
// - in other words, we are calling the 'then' method on the resolved value of the promise
// - in this case, the promise returns a 'response object', which I assume has to do with an http request
// - this is why when we define the callback function of the 'this' method, we name the argument 'response'
// - but dont get confused, the argument is still the resolved value of the promise that the 'then' method has just been called on
// - the 'then' keyword always returns a promise, whether we return anything or not
// - if we do return a value, then that value will become the "fulfillment value" of the returned promise... aka it will become the resolved value
// - so the 'then' method returns a promise whose resolved value equals what we return
// - in this case, we return the response object of the previous promise, but after it has the 'json' method called on it
// - the 'json' method is also asynchronous, which means it will create a promise as well
// - just remember that we are returning the result of this, and that result will be the resolved value of the 'then' method
// - once the promise that the 'then' method returns has been fulfilled, we chain another 'then' method on it
// - in this case, the promises's resolved value is the result of the previous promise after the 'json' method has been called on it, which produces the data we want
// - this is why when we define the callback method of the 'this' method, we name the argument 'data'
// - we access the first index of this argument because of how it is stored(not explaining this right now)
// - we use this data to render the country card
// - we then use its border property to check if it has neighbors
// - if it doesn't, the

//////////////////////////////////////////////////

// General:

// Handling Rejected Promises:
// - remember that a promise in which an error happened is a rejected promise
// - the only way a fetch promise rejects is when the user loses their internet connection
// - that will be the error we are handling here
// - we can simulate this by going into our browser console, going to the network tab and changing the speed to 'offline'
// - we also need to add a button that will attempt the AJAX calls when pressed
// - so what we do is allow the page to load, then change the speed to offline, then press the button

// There are two ways of handling rejections:
//  We can pass a second callback function into the 'then' method:
// - the first callback is always going to be called for the fulfilled method
// - but we can also pass in a second callback which will be called when the promise is rejected
// - this second callback will be called with an argument which is basically the error itself
// - this will 'catch' the error, which is what we call it when we handle an error
// - we would have to do this for every 'then' method... which sucks
// - however, we can do this in a much cleaner and easier way
// - we can actually chain a method at the very end of the chain called 'catch', and pass the callback to handle errors  as an argument
// - this 'catch' method at the end of the chain will basically catch any errors that occur in any place in this whole promise chain, no matter where that is
// - errors basically propagate down the chain until they are caught
// - we only get the 'uncaught' error if the error is not caught anywhere
// - we can handle this error by logging it to the console
// - note that 'catch' itself also returns a promise, allowing us to chain the 'finally' method which we talk about further down

// - usually, just logging the information to the console is not enough in a real application with a real UI
// - so instead, we can also display an error message for the user to see
// - in this case we will use the renderError function that we created earlier

// Note:
// - the error generated by the 'catch' method is actually a real JS object
// - we can create errors in JS with a constructor, ex just like a map or a set
// - any error in JS that was created like this contains the message property
// - we can use this to only print the message of that error and not the whole object itself

// There is one more method that is available on all methods: FINALLY:
// - besides 'then' and 'catch', there is also the 'finally' method
// - also takes a callback as an argument, this callback will be called ALWAYS, whether the whole chain was successful or if it fails
// - this method is not always useful, but it can be sometimes
// - we use this method for something that needs to happen no matter the result of the promise
// - one example of that is to hide a loading spinner
// - some applications show a spinner when an asynchronous operation starts, and then hide it once the operation completes
// - this happens regardless of the operations success, which is a perfect situation to use the finally method
// - in our case, we always need to change the container's opacity to visible so that we can render either the country or the error depending on the success of the operation

// Handling Rejected Promises:
const getCountriesError = function (country) {
  // Country 1
  fetch(`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${country}`)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
      renderCountry(data[0]);
      const neighbour = data[0].borders[0];

      if (!neighbour) return;

      // Country 2
      return fetch(`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/alpha/${neighbour}`);
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => renderCountry(data[0], 'neighbour'))
    // Catching any possible errors in the chain, at the end of the chain:
    .catch(err => {
      // Printing error object to console:
      console.error(`${err} üí©üí©üí©`);
      // Printing error message to UI:
      renderError(`Something went wrong üí©üí© ${err.message}. Try agiain!`);
    })
    // Rendering the container, regardless of success status:
    .finally(() => {
      countriesContainer.style.opacity = 1;
    });
};

// Adding a button - when pressed, executes the function containing the AJAX calls
btn.addEventListener('click', function () {
  // Will cause an 'uncaught' error if internet connection fails
  getCountriesError('canada');
});

//Explaining comments:

// Catching any possible errors in the chain, at the end of the chain:
// - we use the 'catch' method at the end of the chain of promises to do this
// - we pass a callback as an argument, which will be executed if there is an error in order to handle it
// - the 'catch' method actually returns a promise as well

// Printing error object to console:
// - we can console.error a custom error message to make it easier for us to understand what went wrong

// Printing error message to UI:
// - we can also render an error in the UI to make things easier for the user to understand what went wrong

// Rendering the container, regardless of success status:
// - we can actually use the 'finally' method to handle certain situations regardless of the success status of the asynchronous operations
// - in this case, we know that both the 'renderCountry' and the 'renderError' methods render a div within the 'contriesContainer' div
// - this 'countiresContainer' div has its display set to none as default
// - we know that whether the promise chain fulfills or rejects, we still need this container to be visible so that either our error message or country card appears
// - so we use the 'finally' method to change the opacity of the container, regardless of the outcome

//////////////////////////////////////////////////

// Throwing Errors Manually
// - when we input a nonsense value into our function, it inserts it into the URL that we pass to the fetch function
// - during the fetch, there is a 404 error because our API cannot find a country with that name
// - even though there was a obviously a big problem with this request, the fetch function still did not reject in this case

// Taking a look at the response object:
// - looking at the 'ok' property of this object, we can see that it is set to false
// - the reason for that is the status code 404
// - note: if the 'property' is true, it will have the status code of 200, meaning the request went well
// - we can use the fact that the response object has an 'ok' value that can be set to false - we use it to reject the promise ourselves manually
// - we can do this by creating a new error a new error, yes - we can create errors lol
// - we do this by using the constructor function 'error()', passing in a message that we want to be the error message

// Checking if the 'ok' property of the response object is false:
// - if it is false we throw an error
// - we can also set the new error message
// - we do this by using the constructor function 'error()', passing in a message that we want to be the error message
// - then we use the throw keyword, which will immediately terminate the current function, just like return does
// - the effect of creating and throwing an error in any 'then' method is that the promise will immediately reject
// - in other words, the 'then' method that the error has been thrown in will return a rejected promise, which will propagate to the 'catch' handler
// - note that the 'throw' keyword acts like a return keyword, ending the function but also returning the new error object
// - this error method clearly reflects the actual problem
// - this will also cause the 'catch' method to catch this error

const getCountriesError2 = function (country) {
  fetch(`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${country}`)
    // Changed the implicit arrow function into an arrow function with a block:
    .then(response => {
      // Taking a look at the response object from the fetch function:
      console.log(response);

      // Checking if the 'ok' property of the response object is false:
      // if (!response.ok)
      // throw new Error(`Country not found (${response.status})`);

      // Since we added the block back, we have to return the response explicitly
      return response.json();
    })
    .then(data => {
      renderCountry(data[0]);
      // const neighbour = data[0].borders[0];
      const neighbour = 'sdfsgsgs';

      return fetch(`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/alpha/${neighbour}`);

    .then(response => {
      // Doing the same thing here, but this makes our code not DRY:

};

//  Produces 404 error during the fetch function, but doesn't catch it:
// getCountriesError2('asdfasdfa'); //uncomment to first thrown error
// getCountriesError2('canada'); //uncomment to test second thrown error

//  Produces a 404 error during the fetch function , but doesn't catch it:
// - this produces a weird error, telling us "cannot read property 'flag' of undefined" - this is the error that gets caught
// - this happens because the API can't find a country that matches our input, so when it tries to access that property - obviously it doesn't exist
// - this also means that the error is caught during the 'renderCountry' method's execution
// - but that is not where the error actually originates, it's not the original cause of the problem, so this information is misleading
// - this error doesn't really reflect the true error, which is simply that our API cannot find any country with the name we passed
// - this is reflected with the status code of 404
// - note that the fetch function only rejects when there is no internet connection
// - with the 404 error, the fetch promise will still get fulfilled, which is why the error isn't caught at the fetch function - where it origiinated
// - since there is no rejection, our catch function cannot pick up on this error
// - in this case, we really want to tell the user that 'no country was found with this name' - which is the origin of the problem

// - just to be clear, the 404 error still happens, what is important to note is that the 'catch' method doesn't catch it
// - so what ever code we set up to deal with errors in the body of the 'catch' function simply won't run

// Why do we handle errors?
// - it's the only/best way we can produce an accurate error message in the UI for the user
// - it's a bad practise to leave a rejected promise hanging around

// Same idea but we are going to export the repetetive functionality into a helper function:
// - this helper function will wrap up the fetch, the error handling, and also the conversion to JSON
// - we do this because it is annoying to do all these steps every time
// - so instead, we are going to encapsulate all of it into one nice function

// New helper function to deal with the fetch function, turning the promise into JSON, and handling the event of an error in that process:
const getJSON = function (url, errorMsg = 'Something went wrong..') {
  // Returning the result of the chain
  return fetch(url).then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`${errorMsg} (${response.status})`);
    return response.json();
  });
};

const getCountriesError3 = function (country) {
  getJSON(`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${country}`, `Country not found`)
    .then(data => {
      renderCountry(data[0]);
      const neighbour = data[0].borders[0];
      // const neighbour = 'sdfsgsgs';
      // Throwing an error for the case where a country actually has no neighbours:
      // - creates a custom message for this scenario that makes sense
      if (!neighbour) throw new Error(`No neighbour found!`);

      return getJSON(
        `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/alpha/${neighbour}`,
        'Country not found'
      );
    })
    .then(data => renderCountry(data[0], 'neighbour'))
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(`${err} üí©üí©üí©`);
      renderError(`Something went wrong üí©üí© ${err.message}. Try agiain!`);
    })
    .finally(() => {
      countriesContainer.style.opacity = 1;
    });
};

//  Produces 404 error during the fetch function, but doesn't catch it:
// getCountriesError3('canada');
// getCountriesError3('asdada');

// NOTE!!!:!:!:!:
// - the fetch function can only return a rejected promise if there is no internet connection
// - that means that the only way a 'catch' method will catch an error from a fetch function is if the error is caused because of internet problems
// - THE .THEN METHOD DOES NOT WORK THIS WAY
// - the 'then' method will return a rejected promise if the function throws an error.. or if we explicitly return a rejected promise
// - so if something goes wrong during the execution of the body of the 'then' methods call back function, a rejected promise will be returned and can be caught
// - this explains the behaviour of our 2nd function example

// Recap:
// - when ever we want to create some error that we want handled in the catch handler, all we need to do is to throw and create a new error
// - of course we can do that for multiple reasons
// - above, we did it for the case where no neighbor can be found

// Asynchronous Behind the Scenes: The Event Loop:

// JS RUntime Review:
// - A JS runtime is basically a container that includes all the different pieces that are necessary to execute JS code
// - the heart of every JS runtime is the engine
// - the engine is where code is actually executed and where objects are stored in memory
// - these two things happen in the call stack and in the heap
// - JS has only one thread of execution, so it can only do one thing at a time
// - there is absolutely no multi-tasking happening in JS itself
// - other languages like Java can execute multiple pieces of code at the same time, but not JS
// - next we have the WEB api's environment
// - these are some api's provided to the engine, but are actually not part of the JS language itself
// - these are thing's like the DOM, TIMERS, fetch API, etc
// - next up is the call-back queue
// - this is a data structure that holds all the ready to be executed call-back functions that are attached to some event that has occurred
// - finally, whenever the call stack is empty the event loop takes call backs from the callback queue and puts them in the callstack so they can be executed
// - so the event loop is the essential piece that makes asynchronous behavior possible in js
// - it's the reason we can have a non-blocking concurrency model in JS
// - a concurrency model is simply how a language handle multiple things at the same time

// - how does this non-blocking concurrency actually work, and why is the event loop so important?

// - focusing on the important parts of the runtime: the call stack, the event loop, the Web APIs and the callback queue
// - A JS engine is built around the idea of a single thread, but if this is the case, how can non blocking code be executed in an asynchronous way?

// - everything related to the DOM is not really part of JS, but of the Web APIs
// - so it's in the web APIs environment where the asynchronous tasks related to the DOM will run
// - e.g. Image loading, Timers, AJAX calls, and really all other asynchronous tasks
// - these asynchronous tasks will all run in the web APIs environment of the browser
// - in the case of an image loading, if we want to do something once the image is finished loading, we have to listen for the 'load' event
// - we do this by adding an event listener to the image element
// - in practice, this means to register this call-back in the web APIs environment exactly where the image is loading
// - the call back will stay there until the load event is emitted

// - asynchronous tasks run in the background - the background being not the engine but the web api environment
// - when a callback is assigned to one of these asynchronous tasks, they are sent to the web api environment with the task
// - call-backs attached to asynchronous tasks  will remain in the web api environment until the task finishes its process.
// - once the task has finished, the callback is moved to the end of the callback queue
// - the callback queue only starts executing the code it contains once the callstack is empty
// - note that the callback queue also includes non-asynchronous dom events like clicks and key presses. They work pretty much the same way except that they don't have any asynchronous process to wait for

// - the event loop is actually what controls when the callback queue can start moving the stored call backs into the call stack
// - The event loop looks into the callstack to see if it's empty, and if it is, it starts executing callback functions from the callback queue in the callstack

// Ex.
const eventLoopTest = function () {
  console.log('Test Start');
  setTimeout(() => console.log('0 sec timer'), 0);
  Promise.resolve('Resolved promise 1').then(res => console.log(res));
  console.log('Test End');
};

// eventLoopTest(); // Uncomment to test

// Test Start
// Test End
// Resolved promise 1
// 0 sec timer

// - top level code gets executed first
// - both the setTimeout and promise are sent to their respective queues immediately (because we programmed it that way)
// - micro-tasks take precedent over normal asynchronous tasks, which is why the promise is printed before the timer

// Building a Simple Promise

// Creating a promise:
const lotteryPromise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  console.log('Lottery draw is happening');
  // Setting timer to make this asynchronous:
  setTimeout(function () {
    // If true, we win the lottery
    if (Math.random() >= 0.5) {
      // If we win, fulfull the promise - using the resolve argument:
      resolve('You WIN üí∞');
    } else {
      // If we lose, reject the promise:
      reject(new Error('You lost your money üí©'));
    }
  }, 2000);
});

lotteryPromise.then(res => console.log(res)).catch(err => console.error(err));

// Promisifying:
// - wrapping callback based functions into promises, in other words -
// - converting callback based asynchronous behavior to promised based

// Creating a promise using the 'new promise' constructor:
// - uses the 'new promise' constructor, stored in a variable of our choice
// - passing it an 'executor' function as an argument, which executes as soon as the promise runs
// - 'executor' function takes two arguments; the 'resolve' and 'reject' functions
// - the 'executor' function contains the promise's asycnchronous behavior that we are trying to handle with the promise
// - it should eventually produce a resolved value, aka the future value of the promise

// If we win, fulfull the promise - using the "resolve" argument:
// - this resolve function marks this promise as fulfilled
// - we pass the fulfilled value of the promise into to this function
// - this allows it to be later consumed by the 'then' method

// If we lose, reject the promise:
// - calling the 'reject' function marks the promise as rejected
// - this is the value that will be passed to the 'catch' method

// Promisifying the setTimeout function:

const wait = function (seconds) {
  // Returning a promise:
  // - don't need to pass a reject argument in this case
  // - this is because it is impossible for a timer to fail
  return new Promise(function (resolve) {
    // Passing the resolve function to the timer:
    // - all we want to happen at the end of the timer is for our promise to be resolved
    setTimeout(resolve, seconds * 1000);
  });

// We want something to happen after a timer of 2 seconds:
wait(2)
  .then(() => {
    // This is what we want to happen after the timer:
    console.log('I waited for 2 seconds');

    // - we must return the function - the function returns a promise which will be resolved
    return wait(1);
  })
  // This is what we want to happen after the second timer:
  // - takes the resolved value of the promise the last 'this' method returned
